1. Dependencies: Both "main.py" and "app/routers/bot.py" will use the fastapi-poe and gpt-2 libraries. "requirements.txt" will list these dependencies.

2. Data Schemas: "app/models/message.py" and "app/models/response.py" will define the data schemas for the messages sent by the user and the responses generated by the bot. These schemas will be used in "app/routers/bot.py" to handle the incoming messages and generate appropriate responses.

3. Function Names: "main.py" will have a function to start the FastAPI application. "app/routers/bot.py" will have functions to handle the incoming messages and generate responses. "ascii_art_generator.py" will have a function to generate ASCII art using gpt-2.

4. Message Names: The bot will respond to any message with "gmgm", except when the message is "!art". These message names will be used in "app/routers/bot.py" to determine the appropriate response.

5. Exported Variables: "main.py" will export the FastAPI application instance. "app/routers/bot.py" will export the router instance. "ascii_art_generator.py" will export the function to generate ASCII art.

6. ID Names of DOM Elements: Not applicable as there is no mention of a frontend or JavaScript in the user's prompt.
